# SportStream

This project was developed for a HACKATHON in Mobile World Congress 20224.


We were asked to use an API[1] developed by Nokia to design a real world use case. 

Our usecase:
The idea consists of having an all-in-one platform for streamings applicable in multiple areas.

Features offered:
- Geo-Tracking Panel for selected devices  (Location Retrieval & Location Verification)
- Area Selection for Dynamic Broadband management (QoS & Location Verification)
- Add/Remove devices into the SDM System (Device Status?)
- Predictive Broadband Allocation for Area-Based Broadband Connection (QoS)
- Sending Notifications to Selected Devices (Device Status)
