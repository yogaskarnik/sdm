# SportStream

This project was developed for a HACKATHON in Mobile World Congress 20224.

### Objective
We were asked to use [Nokia API](https://developer.networkascode.nokia.io/) developed by Nokia to design a real world use case. 

### Our usecase:
The idea consists of having an all-in-one platform for streamings applicable in multiple areas.

### Features developed:
- Geo-Tracking Panel for selected devices  (Location Retrieval & Location Verification)
- Area Selection for Dynamic Broadband management (QoS & Location Verification)
- Add/Remove devices into the SDM System (Device Status?)
- Predictive Broadband Allocation for Area-Based Broadband Connection (QoS)
- Sending Notifications to Selected Devices (Device Status)
